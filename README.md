# React Album App

This is a simple React application that allows you to fetch, add, update, and delete albums. It uses the JSONPlaceholder API for making dummy HTTP requests to manage the album data. Please note that these operations won't actually modify the server data but demonstrate how to perform these actions in a React application.

## Features

- Fetch albums from the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums).
- Add an album via a POST request to the API (dummy request).
- Update an album via a PUT request to the API (dummy request).
- Delete an album via a DELETE request to the API (dummy request).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the React Album App locally:

### Prerequisites

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-album-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```

3. Install the project dependencies using npm or yarn:

   ```

### Running the App

4. Start the development server:

   ```

5. The app will be available in your web browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

- The home page will display a list of albums fetched from the JSONPlaceholder API.
- To add a new album, click the "Add Album" button. This will make a POST request to the API and add a dummy album to the list.
- To update an album, click the "Edit" button on an album card, make changes, and click the "Update" button. This will make a PUT request to the API (dummy request) to update the album.
- To delete an album, click the "Delete" button on an album card. This will make a DELETE request to the API (dummy request) and remove the album from the list.
